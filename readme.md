## Differences from [`normalize.css`](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)

- Smaller
- Includes only normalizations for the latest Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- [Sets `box-sizing: border-box`](https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/)
- [Improves consistency of default fonts](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize/issues/3)
- [Sets a more readable tab size](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize/issues/17)

All credit should go to `normalize.css`. I just removed some cruft and added some improvements. If you have questions about the source, check out the [original source](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/blame/master/normalize.css) and [this](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css#extended-details-and-known-issues) for details.

[**The goal of this project is to make itself obsolete.**](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize/issues/2)

## FAQ

### Can you provide Sass, Less, etc, ports?

There's absolutely no reason to have separate ports for these. They are just CSS supersets and can import CSS directly.
